Messages doesn't have a cmd-k or cmd-t shortcut to jump to the next conversation like Slack does.
You can change keyboard shortcuts in any Mac app with Menu commands by going to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts.
Do this and select Messages.
Make 2 new shortcuts:
- Go to Previous Conversation: cmd-k
- Go to Next Conversation: cmd-j

Make sure you get the capitalization right, otherwise it won't work (but it won't error either).
